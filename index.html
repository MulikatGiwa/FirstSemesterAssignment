          <div>
            <p>
              Mulikat Giwa is a lady in her late twenties from Lagos State,
              Nigeria.

            <p>
              She enjoys taking pictures of nature and spending time with
              friends and family.
            </p>
            <p>
              She currently lives with her 2 year old daughter and husband in
              Saudi Arabia.
            </p>
            <p>

              in Lagos, Nigeria before relocating with her family.
            </p>

          <h2>Why Altschool?</h2>
          <div>
            <p>The question should be 'Why not Altchool?'</p>
            <p>
              Mulikat Giwa heard about Altschool Africa from a friend of hers
              who is also a front end engineering student of Altschool.
            </p>
            <p>
              Prior to this, she had always considered a switch to the tech
              industry given her young family and limited oppotunities as a
              foreign Architectural designer in Saudi Arabia.
            </p>
            <p>
              She had come across various courses and schools but non really
              looked like they would give the foundation she hoped to build
              while switching to a different career path.
            </p>
            <p>
              On learning about how structured and information packed the
              programme at Altschool Africa was she decided to enroll in the
              school of Engineering programme.
